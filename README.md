## My process

### Built with
- React
  - useState()
  - useEffect()
  - Axios
  - async await
  - onClick()
  - onChange()
- CSS 

### What I learned

I have learned how to set up React App, render React Components, use images in React, import CSS files into React, use states and effects, import Axios with npm, make API calls, and make async await functions inside useEffect().

### Continued development

The project could be improved by adding additional text fields, adding custom images and fonts.
